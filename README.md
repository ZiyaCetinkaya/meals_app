# Meals App

This is the second project which I developed in the flutter learning process.

## About The App
I did this project by following the course which is published by [Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller](https://www.udemy.com/user/academind) on Udemy. [Click here](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps) to access this course. I made this application after watching the 7th part of the course. 

## New Features

Apart from the improvements which is made in the course, I made the following additions:
* I renewed the designs of the category list, meal item and meal detail screens.
* I added the HomeScreen screen:
  - I added an item for HomeScreen to the BottomNavigationBar.
  - I added the Search Meal field for the meal search process.
  - I added the Popularity field to the Meal class. In HomeScreen, I ordered the meals according to the Popularity field and listed them in the Popular Meals area.
  - I added the CreatedAt field to the Category class. In HomeScreen, I ordered the meals according to the CreatedAt field and listed them in the Last Added Categories area.

As I complete the other sections in the course, I want to continue to share by making additions to the projects.
